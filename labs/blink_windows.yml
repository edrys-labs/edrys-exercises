        # Welcome to the Edrys -  Blink - challenge

        This is a simple exercise to get you started with Arduino development.

        In this exercise you will need to write a program that will turn on and off the built-in LED.


        ## Open a station

        To get started, open the station where the code editor will be available.

        (a new station will appear on the navigation bar on the left.
        Click on it and you will be redirected to the station.)

        ## Welcome for Teachers


        > This can be used as a base laboratory to create further and more
        elaborate labs with [edrys-Lite](https://edrys-labs.github.io).

        > You are currently in the Lobby. If there is a station available you can
        switch to it and try out the terminal.

        > Otherwise, if you are in teacher-mode you can share a lab by clicking
        onto `setting` >> `station` and then by clicking the presented link,

        > which is the same as the current link, but only with the word `station`
        instead of `classroom`.

        # Arduino Tutorial


        ## Your First Project - The Blinking LED


        **Objective**: To make an LED blink on and off every second.


          - Start writing your code in the editor on the left.
          - Click on the `Run` button to compile and upload your code to the Arduino board.
          - The LED should start blinking on and off every second, if the code is correct.

        ## Instructions for Station-Sharing 

        You are currently responsible for sharing a station of this lab.


        This lab is designed for stations running on a windows machine.


        To allow other users to access the station and upload their code to the connected board, you need to run the following server locally:


        https://github.com/jh-488/edrys_server
    showInCustom: station
    width: half
    height: huge
  - url: https://edrys-labs.github.io/module-station-stream/index.html

    stationConfig:
      video: true
      audio: false
    showInCustom: Station
    width: half
    height: medium
