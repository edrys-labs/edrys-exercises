    In this lab, you will learn how to write a simple C++ program that calculates
    the sum of two numbers. You will use the C++ programming language to create a
    program that takes two numbers as input, adds them together, and then displays
    the result. This lab is designed for beginners who are new to programming and
    want to learn the basics of C++ programming. By the end of this lab, you will
    have a working C++ program that can add two numbers together and display the
    result.

      ### Introduction to C++ Programming

      **What is C++?**

      C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that is used to create
      a wide variety of software applications. It is an extension of the C
      programming language and provides additional features such as object-oriented
      programming and support for generic programming. C++ is widely used in the
      development of system software, application software, device drivers, and
      video games.

      **Task Overview:**

      In this lab, you will learn how to write a simple C++ program that calculates
      the sum of two numbers. You will use the C++ programming language to create a
      program that takes two numbers as input, adds them together, and then displays
      the result.

      > This can be used as a base laboratory to create further and more
      elaborate labs with [edrys-Lite](https://edrys-labs.github.io).

      > You are currently in the Lobby. If there is a station available you can
      switch to it and try out the terminal.

      > Otherwise, if you are in teacher-mode you can share a lab by clicking
      onto `setting` >> `station` and then by clicking the presented link,

      > which is the same as the current link, but only with the word `station`
      instead of `classroom`.

      # Introduction to C++ Programming

      **Objective**: Create a simple C++ program that calculates the sum of two numbers.


      1. **Write Your Code**:

        - On the editor, modify the starting code to create a function that calculates the sum of two numbers.

      2. **Compile and Run**:

        - Click on the "Run Code" button to compile and run your program.

      3. **See the Magic**: 
      
        - Once uploaded, the compiled program will run on the terminal. If everything is correct, 
        you should see the sum of the two numbers displayed on the screen. Otherwise, an error message will be shown.


      ### Wrap-Up

      Congratulations! You have successfully completed the lab. You have created a simple C++ program that calculates the sum of two numbers.

      ## Instructions for Station-Sharing 


      You are currently responsible for sharing a station of this lab.

      You have multiple options to share a or your terminal.

      Therefor we use the pyxtermjs - terminal server from:


      https://github.com/edrys-labs/module-pyxtermjs


      ### Using Docker


      If you haven't done it so far, install
      [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

      Or, follow one of the instruction-videos for your system:


      <details>

      <summary>Install Docker on Linux</summary>  

      <iframe
        style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cqbh-RneBlk?si=juvUM5d2OSZ28WBv"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </details>


      <details>

      <summary>Install Docker on Windows</summary>

      <iframe
        style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDEdRmTCSs8?si=X0agStn1akNcZLGu"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </details>


      <details>

      <summary>Install Docker on MacOS</summary>

      <iframe
        style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-EXlfSsP49A?si=OZ_l4_2hDKb6ULQ_"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </details>


      Then the only thing that is required is to run the following command:


      ```bash

      docker run -it -p 5000:5000
      --device=/dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0
      edrys-labs/pyxterm-server:latest

      ```


      This will download the pyxtermjs terminal-server from docker-hub and run
      it in a secure environment.

      ### Using Python


      You can also share your terminal directly via Python, visit the following
      project


      https://github.com/edrys-labs/module-pyxtermjs/tree/feat/trzsz


      ... the easiest way is to perform the following steps:


      ``` bash

      # 1. clone the repository or download the folder manually

      git clone https://github.com/edrys-labs/module-pyxtermjs/tree/feat/trzsz


      # 2. install all required sources

      pip3 install -r requirements.txt


      # 3. run the terminal-server

      python3 -m pyxtermjs --cors True --command bash --port 5000

      ```
